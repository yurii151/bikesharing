# bikesharing

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the users trends of renting bikes for a New York City bike sharing service. Before I could convert the data needed for the analysis into Tableau, I had to use python to convert the type of the tripduration column to make the analysis work. This description starts after the data was ready for use, but my .ipynb can be found in the repository.

## Results

The results below can be found at this  [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/6Q84RJSQ4?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### Bike Usage Per Hour

The first thing analyzed was what time were the least amount of being rented:

We found that there is a severe drop in bike usages in the hours of 12-2 in the morning. This is when we would likely want to do repairs to minimize the amount of bikes being unavailabe. 

### Bike Usage Per Hour by Gender

Analyzing the first chart we can break the users down by gender:

We find that while there is a steep drop in users from the times 12-2 AM, men are dominating the bike usage in those times.
